## Introduction

In this repo I expose different methods to extract data using hidden or internal APIs present on dynamic sites without having to use scraping programs that simulate javascript.

---


I choose to use `Requests` and `Scrapy`  librairies

The data was extracted from 3 fashion sites :

- [Banana Repulic](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/)
- [Shop Dia](https://shop.dia.com/)
- [Asos](https://www.asos.com/)
